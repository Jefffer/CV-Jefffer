# Environment Variables Template
# 
# NOTE: As of the latest update, public API keys (EmailJS, reCAPTCHA) are now 
# stored in src/config/public.config.js for better compatibility with deployment 
# platforms like Vercel, Netlify, etc.
#
# This .env file is kept for future private/secret keys if needed.
# Currently, no environment variables are required for the application to run.

# Example: If you need private/secret keys in the future, add them here
# VITE_PRIVATE_API_KEY=your_private_key_here
# VITE_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
